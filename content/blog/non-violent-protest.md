Nobody understands nonviolent protest.

Nonviolent protest is not simply a protest in which protesters don't physically aggress. That is, *lack of violence is necessary, but not sufficient, for "nonviolent protest."*

**Nonviolent protest:**

* **must be provocative.** If nobody cares, nobody will respond. Gandhi didn't do boring things. He took what (after rigorous self examination) he determined was rightfully his, such as salt from the beaches of his own country, and interrupted the British economy, and *provoked a violent response against himself.*
* **must be *certain* not to justify the violent reactions they receive.** It cannot succeed without rigorous self-examination to make sure you, the protester, are not committing injustice.
* **"hurts, like all fighting hurts.** You will not deal blows, but you will receive them." (from the movie Gandhi -- [one of my favorite movie scenes of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hS1YWtalPY)[](https://priceless-perlman-1612f9.netlify.app/non-violent-protest/))
* **demands respect by demonstrating respectability.** The courage to get hit and keep coming back while offering no retaliation is one of the few things that can really make a man go, "Huh. How about that."
* **does not depend on the what the "enemy" does** in order to be successful. It depends on the commitment to nonviolence.

A lack of violence is not necessarily nonviolent protest. Nonviolence is a philosophy, not a description of affairs, and in order for it to work, it must be understood and practiced. Since Martin Luther King, few Americans have done either (BLM included). I suspect part of the reason the authorities often encourage nonviolent protest is that so few citizens know what it really entails. **Both non-provocative "nonviolent" protests and violent protests allow injustice to continue.**

The civil rights protests of the 60s were so effective because of the stark contrast between the innocence of the protesters and the brutality of the state. **That is what all nonviolent protest depends upon -- the assumption that their oppressors will *not* change their behavior**, and will thus sow their own downfall if one does not resist. Protesters must turn up the heat against themselves, while doing nothing unjust (though perhaps illegal) and receiving the blows.

["If we fight back, we become the vandals and they become the law."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fys2Lvv7VEA)[](https://priceless-perlman-1612f9.netlify.app/non-violent-protest/) (from the movie Gandhi)

**For example:**

**How to end "zero tolerance policies" at schools:**

If you're an innocent party in a fight, refuse to honor the punishment. This will make them punish you more. But they will have to provide an explanation -- "because he was attacked, or stood up for someone who was being attacked, etc." Continue to not honor punishments. Refuse to acknowledge them. If you're suspended, go to school. Make them take action against you. In the meantime, do absolutely *nothing* objectionable. The worse they punish you for -- literally! -- doing nothing, the more ridiculous they will seem.

They will have to raise the stakes to ridiculous heights, handing out greater and greater punishments, and ultimately it will come down to "because he didn't obey a punishment he didn't deserve." The crazier the punishments they hand down, the more attention it will get, and the more support you will get, and the more bad press the administration will get, until it is forced to hand out a proper ruling.

Step 1) Disobey unjust punishments / laws

Step 2) Be absolutely harmless, polite, and rule-abiding otherwise

Step 3) Repeat until media sensation

This is exactly what Gandhi and MLK did, more or less. Nonviolent protests are a lot more than "declining to aggress" -- they're active, provocative, and bring shit down on your head. This is how things get changed.

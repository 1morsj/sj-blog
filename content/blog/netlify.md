I started blogging in sometime after 2000, first on some blogging platform, then on Blogger and later moving on to self-hosted Wordpress site.

Wordpress site has been a learning experience. Though there was not much to learn on shared hosting, once I moved to unmanaged VPS server, there was a lot to learn. I haven't made much changes to my blog in a few years and I figured it was time to shift again, this time to a static site. I did experiment a bit with it, but never actually made the move. With Netlify CMS, I figured this is something that I should seriously consider.

So here is my first post, I will try to migrate my older posts from Wordpress over time.
